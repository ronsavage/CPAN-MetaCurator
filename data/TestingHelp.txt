o Overview of conversion from Test::More to Test2::V0:
<pre>
Test2 has a "migration guide" manual that you might find useful:

  https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Manual::Testing::Migrating

Though honestly I find I get my tests about 99% correct already by
simply doing:

  $ find -name \*.t | xargs sed -i 's/use Test::More/use Test2::V0/'
  $ find -name \*.t | xargs sed -i 's/is_deeply(/is(/'

then manually editing any other edge-cases that I find; but that's
perhaps easier because my existing test style already mostly matched
what Test2 wanted.

I gave this a bash in a codebase I help maintain, and it worked well
enough, save for the fact that we use(d) the "tests => <num_tests>"
syntax, so I had to get rid of that and add "done_testing" to the end of
all the tests. I never enjoyed counting and updating the number of tests
anyway, so I consider this an improvement :-)

FWIW, the replacement of this is a subsequent call to plan($num); but
done_testing is certainly more commonly used as maintenance of the plan
tends to be more trouble than it's worth.
