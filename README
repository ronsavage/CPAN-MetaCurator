This file is the README for CPAN::MetaCurator

Purpose

To convert a curated subset of Perl modules from the feed at
https://metacpan.org/recent into both a TiddlyWiki & a tree managed by JSTree.

The data: see both the TiddlyWiki called Perl.Wiki.html in my Wiki Haven at
http://savage.net.au/, and the corresponding JSTree version of that wiki as well.

Installation of CPAN::MetaCurator

Use the cpan command line client:
cpanm CPAN::MetaCurator
