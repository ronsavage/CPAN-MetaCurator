[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44141] [516778] [info] Starting topic: **Key Considerations**
[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44143] [516778] [info] Starting topic: * **Version Constraints:** You can specify version constraints for your dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability. For example
[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44145] [516778] [info] Starting topic:     ```perl
[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44147] [516778] [info] Starting topic:     require 'Module::Name' => '>= 1.2.3';
[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44149] [516778] [info] Starting topic:     ```
[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44150] [516778] [info] Starting topic: * **Local Modules:** If you have local modules that are not on CPAN, you can add them to your `cpanfile` using special directives.
[2025-07-17 15:02:34.44152] [516778] [info] Starting topic: * **Testing:** After generating your `cpanfile`, always test your application to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and your application functions as expected.
