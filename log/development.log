[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28499] [381735] [info] Starting topic:     This creates a basic `cpanfile` with some default settings. You can then manually add your project's specific dependencies.
[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28500] [381735] [info] Starting topic: **Key Considerations**
[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28502] [381735] [info] Starting topic: * **Version Constraints:** You can specify version constraints for your dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability. For example
[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28504] [381735] [info] Starting topic:     ```perl
[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28505] [381735] [info] Starting topic:     require 'Module::Name' => '>= 1.2.3';

[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28508] [381735] [info] Starting topic: * **Local Modules:** If you have local modules that are not on CPAN, you can add them to your `cpanfile` using special directives.
[2025-07-12 16:44:36.28510] [381735] [info] Starting topic: * **Testing:** After generating your `cpanfile`, always test your application to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and your application functions as expected.
