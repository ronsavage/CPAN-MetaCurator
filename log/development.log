- use List::Util 'any' or, better, 'first' (but don't use first() for finding 0 or undef!)
- And then 1 of:
- if(any { $_ eq $thing } @values) ...
- if(any { $_ == $thing } @values) ...
- It's not limited to just string or number comparison of course; you can
put any arbitrary code in there. if(any { $_->is_close_to(123.45) } @values) ...
- Or
- If you don't like the XSUB call overhead of List::Util::any, there's
another (non-core) CPAN module List::Keywords which implements many of
the same utilities as real keywords with real opcodes, so they run
faster.
- use List::Keywords 'any';

- Audit CPAN distributions for known vulnerabilities
- https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN-Audit
- This module contains cpan-audit, which uses a cpanfile or a cpanfile.snapshot file

o Docs:
- The docs here were copied from Google's Gemini, when I asked it how to generate a cpanfile
<pre>
**1. Manual Creation**

* **Create a file named `cpanfile`:** This file will reside in the root directory of your project.
* **Add dependencies:**
    * Each line in the `cpanfile` represents a dependency.
    * Use the following syntax: `require 'ModuleName';`
    * Example:
      ```perl
        require 'JSON';
        require 'Template';
        require 'DateTime';
        require 'DBIx::Class';
        `

**2. Using `Mojolicious::Command::Author::generate::cpanfile`**

* **Install the Mojolicious framework (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    cpanm Mojolicious
    ```
* **Generate the `cpanfile`:**
    ```bash
    mojo generate cpanfile
    ```
    This command analyzes your Perl source code files (usually located in the `lib` directory) to identify used modules and generates the `cpanfile` accordingly.

**3. Using Carton**

* **Install Carton:**
    ```bash
    cpanm Carton
    ```
* **Create a `cpanfile`:**
    ```bash
    carton init
    ```
    This creates a basic `cpanfile` with some default settings. You can then manually add your project's specific dependencies.

**Key Considerations**

* **Version Constraints:** You can specify version constraints for your dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability. For example:
    ```perl
    require 'Module::Name' => '>= 1.2.3';
    ```
* **Local Modules:** If you have local modules that are not on CPAN, you can add them to your `cpanfile` using special directives.
* **Testing:** After generating your `cpanfile`, always test your application to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and your application functions as expected.

**Example `cpanfile`**

```perl
require 'JSON';
require 'Template' => '>= 2.18';
require 'DateTime';
require 'DBIx::Class';
require 'MyLocalModule'; # A hypothetical local module
```

By using a `cpanfile`, you can easily manage and install the necessary dependencies for your Perl projects, making your development process more efficient and reproducible.

o Note: GraphViz2::DBI ships with db.schema.pl, which creates an SVG image of a schema:
- To run it you need to set three environment variables as below
- dbi.schema.pl takes an option parameter of image type, which defaults to svg
- Edit the code if you wish to change the output dir's name
- The last line, the copy, is for my setup. $DR points to a RAM disk. Debian automatically creates a RAM disk, so I configure the free web server Engine X, aka nginx, to use it. See my other TiddlyWiki, Debian.Wiki.html, for details about nginx
- And yes, you can use empty strings for the username and password
- Lastly, $ is just the command line prompt

o Syntax::Operator::Equ:
- equ and === are operators similar to eq and ==, except that they are aware that undef is distinct from the empty string or the number zero and don't compare the same. Useful combined with match/case
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Syntax::Operator::Equ

o Syntax::Operator::Elem:
- elem and similar operators, and the `in` meta-operator allow you to easily ask the question "does this string appear in that set of strings?" or similar for numbers. Useful combined with match/case
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Syntax::Operator::Elem
- Samples:
- $x elem @strings   # is a stringy comparison
- $x â @numbers    # is a numbery comparison
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Syntax::Operator::In
- $x in:isa @classes

- $n â @nums          # like  any { $n == $_ } @nums
- Yes, this is a UTF-8 named operator. No I will not apologise

o Syntax::Operator::Equ:
- Equality operators that distinguish undef
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Syntax::Operator::Equ
- $str equ $str        # like eq but cares about undef
- $num === $num  # like == but cares about undef

o Syntax::Operator::Is:
- Match operator using Data::Checks constraints
- https://metacpan.org/dist/Syntax-Operator-Is

o Syntax::Operator::Zip:
- Infix operator to compose two lists together
- https://metacpan.org/pod/Syntax::Operator::Zip

o Google Bard says:
Command-line options:

    DiffPDF: Lightweight and simple, free and open-source. Compares text and images, highlights differences, can exclude margins and generate reports. However, lacks advanced features like layout or visual side-by-side comparison.
    Wdiff: Text-based diff tool, often installed by default. Good for textual comparisons, but not suitable for visual layout differences.

Graphical diff tools:

    Kompare: Powerful diff and merge tool for various file types, including PDFs. Supports side-by-side comparison, highlights differences, visual and textual comparisons. Has a steeper learning curve compared to simpler tools.
    Meld: Another popular diff and merge tool with side-by-side comparison, advanced filtering options, and support for directory comparisons.
    Diffuse: Lightweight GUI diff tool specifically for PDFs. Focuses on visual comparison with side-by-side view and highlighting. Lacks advanced features of some other tools.

Commercial options:

    Beyond Compare: Feature-rich diff and merge tool for various file types, including PDFs. Advanced comparison modes, visual and textual differences, filtering options, report generation, etc. Paid software.
    DiffMerge: Cross-platform diff tool with a GUI and powerful comparison engine for files and directories. Supports PDF comparison with side-by-side view, text alignment, and highlighting. Paid software.

Web-based options:

    Copyleaks: Online plagiarism checker that can compare PDFs and highlight text differences. Supports multiple languages. Free trial available, then paid subscription.

Here are some additional factors to consider when choosing a PDF comparison tool:

    Complexity of PDFs: For simple PDFs with just text, basic tools like DiffPDF might suffice. More complex PDFs with layouts and images might require something like Kompare or DiffMerge.
    Type of comparison: Do you need purely textual comparison, visual layout comparison, or both?
    Advanced features: Do you need options like filtering, reporting, or merging the PDFs?
    Budget: Some tools are free and open-source, while others are paid commercial options

o Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically:
- Dynamically change the value of a variable
- Effectively:
{
   my $old = $VAR;
   $VAR = "new value";

   ...

   $VAR = $old;
}
- Except that the old value will also be restored in the case of exceptions, goto, next/last/redo or similar ways to leave the controlling block scope.

o Overview of conversion from Test::More to Test2::V0:
<pre>
Test2 has a "migration guide" manual that you might find useful:

  https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Manual::Testing::Migrating

Though honestly I find I get my tests about 99% correct already by
simply doing:

  $ find -name \*.t | xargs sed -i 's/use Test::More/use Test2::V0/'
  $ find -name \*.t | xargs sed -i 's/is_deeply(/is(/'

then manually editing any other edge-cases that I find; but that's
perhaps easier because my existing test style already mostly matched
what Test2 wanted.

I gave this a bash in a codebase I help maintain, and it worked well
enough, save for the fact that we use(d) the "tests => <num_tests>"
syntax, so I had to get rid of that and add "done_testing" to the end of
all the tests. I never enjoyed counting and updating the number of tests
anyway, so I consider this an improvement :-)

FWIW, the replacement of this is a subsequent call to plan($num); but
done_testing is certainly more commonly used as maintenance of the plan
tends to be more trouble than it's worth.

[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94820] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770361. Though honestly I find I get my tests about 99% correct already by
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94822] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770362. simply doing

[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94828] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770366. perhaps easier because my existing test style already mostly matched
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94830] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770367. what Test2 wanted.
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94831] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770368. I gave this a bash in a codebase I help maintain, and it worked well
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94833] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770369. enough, save for the fact that we use(d) the "tests => <num_tests>"
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94835] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770370. syntax, so I had to get rid of that and add "done_testing" to the end of
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94836] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770371. all the tests. I never enjoyed counting and updating the number of tests
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94838] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770372. anyway, so I consider this an improvement :-)
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94840] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770373. FWIW, the replacement of this is a subsequent call to plan($num); but
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94842] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770374. done_testing is certainly more commonly used as maintenance of the plan
[2025-08-02 08:40:30.94843] [76041] [info] Starting leaf: id: 1770375. tends to be more trouble than it's worth.

o Escape character for '/' is '#&47;'. See also /''''/ and '////'. Click edit (pencil) to examine

o Care! TiddlyWikis contains executable code in order to provide all the features listed below:
- Your download or antivirus software might complain

o Overview:
- Each TiddlyWiki is restricted to a single web page
- Each page must use named paragraphs
- The purpose of these restrictions is to impose guidelines for the naming of things
- These guidelines help people with no expertise in data collation to index items carefully
- So, they help prevent growth-like-topsy, a major problem will old-style wikis
- Do yourself a favour and always include a para in every TiddlyWiki called MainMenu (or Index or TableOfContents), and put in it an alphabetical list of para names

o Inbuilt features of all TiddlyWikis:
- Search engine
- Editor (can be sent commands, and can generate HTML)
- The 3 double-quotes at the top of this para is one such command, but they are only visible when you click the pencil (edit) icon to enter edit mode for a para
- Encryption (good for passwords)
