[2026-02-01 12:50:36.08943] [990687] [debug] g. Topic is Why are AI agents so dangerous => The fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They donât have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap

[2026-02-01 12:50:36.08955] [990687] [debug] g. Topic is What is the problem => In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?
