[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76935] [397197] [info] Starting topic: * **Install Carton:**
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76937] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     ```bash
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76939] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     cpanm Carton
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76941] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     ```
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76942] [397197] [info] Starting topic: * **Create a `cpanfile`:**
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76944] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     ```bash
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76946] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     carton init
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76948] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     ```
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76950] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     This creates a basic `cpanfile` with some default settings. You can then manually add your project's specific dependencies.
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76951] [397197] [info] Starting topic: **Key Considerations**
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76953] [397197] [info] Starting topic: * **Version Constraints:** You can specify version constraints for your dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability. For example
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76955] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     ```perl
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76957] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     require 'Module::Name' => '>= 1.2.3';
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76959] [397197] [info] Starting topic:     ```
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76960] [397197] [info] Starting topic: * **Local Modules:** If you have local modules that are not on CPAN, you can add them to your `cpanfile` using special directives.
[2025-07-13 13:28:38.76962] [397197] [info] Starting topic: * **Testing:** After generating your `cpanfile`, always test your application to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and your application functions as expected.
